# Tanaguru

Tanaguru is an opensource (AGPL license) website assessment tool. It is dedicated to accessibility (a11y) audits, and focuses on reliability and high level of automation.

## Features

Four kinds of audit:

* offline file audit
* page audit
* entire website audit (Heritrix crawler embedded)
* scenario audit 

(That's the DOM that is tested, thus dealing with JS/AJAX/ARIA)
 
## Vision

1. Automate as much as we can and even more :)
2. Be 200% reliable (don't give erroneous result)
3. have technological fun
